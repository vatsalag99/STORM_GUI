Notes 


1
- Need Instruction: Instructions for moving (could add this to the README) 
- Spinbox to change the jump-step size and also allow for manual frame jump 

2
- Drag and drop dax files 

3 
- Input parameters don't allow for min and max frame setting - we need these to from 0-100000

4
- Input parameters should auto-populate with the XML data in the root data folder 
- load XLs and have the advanced feature tab populate it accordingly 

5
- should update the max frame and the drift correction parameters 

6
- Add exceptions to the error dialogs.
